- ✅ **Production-Ready Code** - Optimized and tested implementations
- ✅ **Frontend Focused** - JavaScript, HTML, CSS fundamentals in action
- ✅ **Documented** - Comprehensive comments and clear code structure
- ✅ **Scalable** - Each project can be extended and customized

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Markup:** HTML5
- **Styling:** CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Responsive Design)
- **Architecture:** Vanilla JS / Modular Components
- **Tools:** Git, VS Code

## Project Structure

The repository is organized by project. Each folder contains all necessary assets for that specific application.

```

├── currencyConverter/
│   ├── codes.js        # Country code mappings
│   ├── index.html      # Application entry point
│   ├── README.md       # Project-specific documentation
│   ├── script.js       # Core logic and API integration
│   └── style.css       # Stylesheet
└── README.md           # Main documentation
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
- A code editor (VS Code recommended).
- Git installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/md-mustafa-hossain-create/js-mini-apps-archive.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd js-mini-apps-archive
   ```

3. **Run a project (e.g., Currency Converter):**
   You can open `currencyConverter/index.html` directly in your browser, or use a local server for better performance:
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   cd currencyConverter
   python -m http.server 8000

   # Or using Node.js http-server
   npx http-server ./currencyConverter
   ```

## Usage

Each project is designed to be self-contained.
- Navigate to the specific project folder.
- Read the project's `README.md` for specific configuration or API key requirements.
- Launch the `index.html` file.

## Code Quality Standards

We adhere to strict coding standards to ensure readability and maintainability:
- **ES6+ Syntax**: Usage of `const`/`let`, arrow functions, and modules.
- **DRY Principle**: Reusable functions and modular code.
- **Semantic HTML**: Accessible and meaningful markup.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach where applicable.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user feedback.

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

1. **Fork** the Project
2. **Create** your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. **Commit** your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. **Push** to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. **Open** a Pull Request

## Learning Outcomes

By exploring these projects, you'll gain hands-on experience with:
- DOM manipulation and event delegation.
- Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, Async/Await, Fetch API).
- Component-based thinking in Vanilla JS.
- CSS layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid) and responsiveness.
- State management basics.
- Git workflow and collaboration.
